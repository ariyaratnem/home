		<h3>What is Power Mimicry?</h3>
		<p>Power mimicry is the ability to replicate powers belonging to other people through physical touch. Power mimicry can be used several ways. From completely replicating a person's powers to use as one's own or even using a person's powers' against them.</p>
		<h3>How I Got This Ability</h3>
		<p>I was born with this ability. And as someone who doesn't know anyone else with this ability it is very hard to control my power. Through trial and error I have begun to understand that my power does not work unless I truly have a reason or I know what I want to do with it.</p>
		<h3>What I Do With My Ability</h3>
		<p>Having an ability such as power mimicry can be extremely useful. While it of course has its drawbacks, I find that the advantages of this power outweigh them. I can use them to make sure I don't get injured even though I'm extremely clumsy. Or I can use them to help me study in a short amount of time.</p>
