		<h2>What is the Big Bang Theory?</h2>
		<p>The Big Bang Theory is a topic in astrophysics and the most widely used explanation of how the universe first came to be.
		In the simplest terms, at some point 13.8 billion years ago universe started as a singularity (zones where finite matter is condensed into infinite <a href="http://www.big-bang-theory.com/">densities</a>)
		that continued to grow and expand into what it is <a href="http://www.space.com/25126-big-bang-theory.html">today.</a></p>
		<h2>What Happened</h2>
		<p>When the universe first appeared, it was extremely hot and the first thing that appeared was an expanse of protons, neutrons, 
		electrons, and photons among others. As the universe rapidly cooled and expanded, the neutrons would become protons or electrons
		<i>or</i> they would combine with protons to make an isotope of hydrogen called deuterium. Before this happened, because electrons would
		have caused photons (light) to scatter causing the universe to be opaque. Once these electrons were used to form neutral atoms, the
		electrons couldn't scatter light and the universe became transparent. These photons became what is known as <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-powered-the-big-bang">cosmic background glow</a>
		and can still be seen today.</p>
		<h2>Timeline</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Singularity Epoch (Planck Epoch)- the earliest period of the universe that we know of. This was the point where all matter was
			condensed at a single point. This is also where the universe first start to cool down and expand.</li>
			<li>Inflation Epoch- the universe was filled with high-energy density. The high temperatures and pressure caused led
			to the universe expanding and cooling quickly.</li>
			<li>Cooling Epoch- the density and temperature of the universe decreasing caused particle energy to decrease.</li>
			<li>Structure Epoch- the denser regions of the universe became attracted each other and grew denser leading to the formation of gas
			clouds, stars, galaxies and <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/54756/what-is-the-big-bang-theory/">others.</a></li>

		<h2>Forces Created by the Big Bang</h2>
		<p>The <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/dictionary/astronomy-terms/big-bang-theory1.htm">four</a> forces created by the Big Bang are:
		<dl>
			<dt>Electromagnetism-</dt><dd>The interaction between electric and magnetic currents/fields.</dd>
			<dt>Strong nuclear force-</dt><dd>The force that holds together the subatomic particles that make up the nucleus. Compared to the other forces, this has to have a short range to be experienced. This is also the basis of the law of attraction.</dd>
			<dt>Weak nuclear force-</dt><dd>The force that causes matter to decay.</dd>
			<dt>Gravity-</dt><dd>The force that pulls down mass towards the center of the Earth or to another physical mass.</dd>
