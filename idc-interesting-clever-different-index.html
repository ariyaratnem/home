		<h1>Interesting, Different, Clever</h1>
		<h2>Interesting</h2>
		<p></p>
		<h2>Clever</h2>
		<p>I found it really clever how you made the border for your images gradient. I thought it added a nice to your web page as it made your page more professional as there wasn't a stark contrast between your image and background.</p>
		<h2>Different</h2>
		<p>I found it really different that you centred everything on your web page. It's not a choice I personally would have made but it works for your page.</p>
